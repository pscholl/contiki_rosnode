 - build test with proper endianess
 - add default messages (Header, Time, Duration)
 - write a small tutorial
 - also check in serialize for buf len! i.e. size_check in *_serialize
 - enums needs some attention

maybe:
 - checkout 64bit compatibility (it's not there, let's see if we can do anyhow
   by modifying the grow_len)
 - replace dfs strategy of deserialize with bfs to avoid multiple counter vars
 - reorder struct declaration to ensure aligned access
