 - build test with proper endianess
 - test complex messages
 - add default messages (Header, Time, Duration)
 - write a small tutorial
 - fix grow_len recursively 
 - also check in serialize for buf len! i.e. size_check in *_serialize
 - enums needs some attention
 - string and message in static arrays are problematic!
 - check if non-initialized arrays exist, i.e. NULL pointers in the arrays!

maybe:
 - checkout 64bit compatibility (it's not there, let's see if we can do anyhow
   by modifying the grow_len)
 - replace dfs strategy of deserialize with bfs to avoid multiple counter vars
 - reorder struct declaration to ensure aligned access


done:
 - emtpy arrays?
